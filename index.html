Hi, I'm Bruce Caraway and I enjoy teaching others especially in the use of the web.  

By day I teach in the Computer and Information Technology Department at <a href="http://lonestar.edu" target="_blank">Lone Star College</a>.   
...and by night I am usually doing something with WordPress.  Either working on a site or coaching someone else how to in <a href="http://www.lonestar.edu/Web-Developer-ce-Certificate.htm" target="_blank">Lone Star Collegeâ€Ž's Continuing Education department</a>.   

When I'm not teaching, I relish...  

- spending time with my wife, Sherri.  
- my role as father to my son and daughter - both blessings beyond imagine.  
- quiet moments reading up on the latest geekery.  
- sharing 'Aha' moments with others, always.   
  
Want to connect or have something to share?  ...then, by all means, give me a <a href="/contact" title="Contact">shout</a>.
