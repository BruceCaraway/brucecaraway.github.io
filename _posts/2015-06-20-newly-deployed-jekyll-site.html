excerpt: This site has been newly launched as a Jekyll site - here's a brief explanation as to why I've opted to do this. <br>

<h2>Why Jekyll</h2>

<p>After hearing about this thing called <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> (a static website and blogging platform) for the past couple of years, I&#8217;ve decided to redeploy this blog as a Jekyll site. Since its inception, this site has existed as a self-hosted WordPress site. But because I don&#8217;t post here that often, maintaining it as a WordPress site proved to be more time consuming (and expensive) than I could justify. Keeping up with plugin updates, staying ever vigilant for the latest security concerns, and hosting the site using a premium hosting service (<a href="http://wpengine.com">WPEngine</a>) were &#8220;costs&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t see maintaining.<br>
Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m still a huge WordPress fan and I even earn a portion of my annual income from WP consulting and coaching. The rest of my sites (both personal and client) will continue to be deployed using WP for the foreseeable future. </p>

<h2>Getting GitHub</h2>

<p>The other big motivation for my move is that there is an option to host your Jekyll site on <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> for free. The free option certainly grabbed my attention but there is another reason for moving, namely GitHub. As an instructor at <a href="http://www.lonestar.edu/cit-dept.htm#universityPark">Lone Star College - University Park</a>, I am going to begin teaching a couple of programming classes this Fall and I plan to bring GitHub into the discussion with my students when we start talking about source control. If I can&#8217;t point to direct experience with a technology, then my ability to teach that technology is questionable at best.<br>
I&#8217;ve taken a couple of GitHub focused classes online but until now, I hadn&#8217;t been able to bring GitHub into my regular workflow. When I read about the integration of Jekyll sites and GitHub Pages, I figured this might finally be the way to inject GitHub into my process and give me &#8220;an excuse&#8221; to use GitHub for a personal project of my own.<br>
So, here&#8217;s the new site. It will be going through a few updates over the next week or two, so there may be some layout changes yet to come. Otherwise, enjoy!</p>
