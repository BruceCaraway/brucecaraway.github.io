Almost feels like the night before Christmas even!<br />
Even so, I'll be hitting the road before sunrise in order to make the 2.5 hour drive over to Austin for this year's <a href="http://austin.wordcamp.com" target="_blank">WordCamp</a>.<br />
This will be my fifth WordCamp and each one has been a valuable experience and well worth the time and travel.  At each of these past camps, I've made some great friends and met some really smart folks that I am better for having met and gotten to know.</p>
<p>If you have a chance to make it to this weekend's WordCamp, get there - You will not regret it!</p>
