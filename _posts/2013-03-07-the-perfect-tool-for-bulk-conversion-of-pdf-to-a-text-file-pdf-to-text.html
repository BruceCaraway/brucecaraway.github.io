Just had that experience with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdf-to-text/id432054682?mt=12#" target="_blank">PDF to Text</a> from SeaSky Software.<br />
I had over a hundred press releases in PDF format that I needed to  quickly extract to text so that each could be converted to a stand-alone blog post.<br />
PDF to Text isn't sophisticated, but it doesn't need to be - it does exactly what it says it does.  As Albert Einstein (supposedly) said:</p>
<blockquote><p><a title="BrainyQuote - Albert Einstein" href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/alberteins103652.html#iJ2Ghg6sUlr5d6BT.99" target="_blank">Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.</a></p></blockquote>
