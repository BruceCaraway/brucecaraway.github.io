<p>I use <a href="http://ithemes.com/member/go.php?r=538&i=b14">iThemes' Builder theme</a> for many of my custom site development projects.  The folks at <a href="http://ithemes.com" target="_blank">iThemes</a> take a great amount of pride in Builder and their entire suite of themes and plugins.</p>
<p>Builder is a powerful and sometimes complex theme to deploy, but don't let that prevent you from giving it a look, especially the every growing library of wonderful child themes that iThemes continues to develop.  If you do decide to purchase Builder, I appreciate your using the following link as it is my affiliate link with iThemes.</p>
