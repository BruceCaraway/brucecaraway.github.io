<p>I've had several friends of mine recommend <a href="http://okaythemes.com" target="_blank">Okay Themes</a> and I finally decided to take the plunge...in fact, you're "soaking in it" as the theme that now runs my site is one of Okay's responsive, one-page designs.  Can you figure out which one?  </p>
<p>Okay's founder, Mike McAlister, is a talented designer/developer that continues to turn out some very effective and cools themes.  Be sure to give them a look!</p>
