<p>Want to quickly zoom-in on something on your Mac screen?  Place your mouse over the area of the screen you want to zoom in on and, while holding the 'control' key, move your mouse Down and watch as your screen zooms in.  To zoom out, just move your mouse Up while holding the 'control' key again.<br />
Note this works regardless of whether you are using an external monitor, even an overhead projector, so this can be a great help when trying to clarify an on-screen demonstration to an audience.</p>
