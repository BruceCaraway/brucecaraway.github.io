Looking forward to catching up with my WordPress friends at [WordCamp Dallas/Fort Worth](https://dfw.wordcamp.org/2015/) this Saturday.  It was at the 2009 WordCamp in Dallas that I forged some lasting friendships and saw a new opportunity for my career (and life) really open up.    
If you haven't gotten your [tickets](https://dfw.wordcamp.org/2015/tickets/) - hurry, they are going fast!  
Can't wait to see you there!
