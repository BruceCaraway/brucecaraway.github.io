<p>(About a year later than I had originally planned, but…) I am officially leaving the realm of corporate IT. I gave my notice to Schlumberger (SLB) during the holiday break. There are several reasons for my decision – some having to to do with the direction of the company and some with my current situation and mindset. I am thankful for my 4+ years of:<br />
◦ working for Smith International and later SLB<br />
◦ learning a great deal more about the Oil &amp; Gas Field<br />
◦ working with some great folks<br />
No regrets now though as it’s time for me to make this move and tackle the challenges ahead…bring on 2012!</p>
