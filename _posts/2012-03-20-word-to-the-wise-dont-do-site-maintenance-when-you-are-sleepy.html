<h2>Don't Do as I Do...</h2>
<p><em>What?!? Where did my site go???</p>
<p>Arrrggghh!!!  #$@&amp;!!!</p>
<p>You never did install BackupBuddy on your own site, did you - you #$@&amp;-ing #@#&amp;!!!<br />
</em></p>
<p>Yep, that was me a couple of weeks ago.  And, now I am finally putting all the pieces back in place.  Slowly.</p>
<h2>Please Do as I Say</h2>
<p>Do yourself a huge favor and get BackupBuddy installed, NOW. It will save you many tears, bad thoughts and moments of self-loathing!</p>
