<p>I've recently started using several of <a href="http://themify.me/member/go.php?r=16626&i=b6">Themify's nifty themes</a> for a couple of sites that I personally maintain.  Many of their themes have a clean, minimalist look that resonates with me.  And I also like their theme customization interface and their use of shortcodes to activate select content areas of my sites.</p>
<p>So take a look at their great portfolio of themes and if you do decide to purchase any one of their themes, I appreciate your using the following link as it is my affiliate link with Themify.</p>
