<p>Got some excellent news that I have been accepted to teach a Continuing Education course at LoneStar College starting next week. The course, is their “HTML I – Intro to Web Design” and 16 students have signed up.<br />
I just got a copy of the class text today so my course syllabus is starting to take shape. Lots of material to cover over the course of 4 days – Gonna be fun!</p>
