excerpt: I really admire David Sparks (<a href="http://twitter.com/macsparky" title="@macsparky" target="_blank">@MacSparky</a> on Twitter) and his amazing ability to turn out really great content while also holding down a full time job as an attorney.<br>

<p><a href="http://brucecaraway.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/paperless.jpg"><img src="/assets/paperless.jpg" alt="Paperless" title="Paperless" width="167" height="222" class="alignright size-full wp-image-90" /></a>I really admire David Sparks (<a href="http://twitter.com/macsparky" title="@macsparky" target="_blank">@MacSparky</a> on Twitter) and his amazing ability to turn out really great content while also holding down a full time job as an attorney.  He co-hosts one of my favorite podcasts, <a href="http://macpowerusers.com/" title="Mac Power Users" target="_blank">Mac Power Users</a> with Katie Floyd (<a href="http://twitter.com/katiefloyd" title="@katiefloyd" target="_blank">@katiefloyd</a>) and has published two solid books, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470877006/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=brucecarnet-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0470877006" target="_blank">Mac at Work</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118100565/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=brucecarnet-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1118100565" target="_blank">iPad at Work</a>.</p>
<p>And, now he has gone and set the bar yet higher again with the self-published release of his <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/paperless/id520393162?mt=11&ign-mpt=uo%3D4" title="Paperless" target="_blank">Paperless: A MacSparky Field Guide</a>.  Apparently, this will be the first of many similar field guides that David plans to release.  And, to make it even more intriguing, he is using Apple's iBooks Author exclusively in writing workflow.  Some may take issue with his choice in using a "proprietary" technology and format that comes in using iBooks, but if he is able to use this to efficiently construct and publish similarly helpful works, more power to him.</p>
<p>Again, I am awed at David Sparks' ability to produce and thankful that he is willing to share so much.</p>
