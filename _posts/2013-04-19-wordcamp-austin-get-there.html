<p>Ever been to a WordCamp? No?!? Then you need to make every effort to go. Usually set in an informal setting, often on a Saturday and/or Sunday, <a href="http://central.wordcamp.org/">Wordcamps</a> are an excellent way to learn about the vibrant and exciting community that is WordPress.<br />
Having attended two in Dallas and one in Houston since 2009, I can say there is probably no better value for your money than what you can attain in attending a WordCamp. In fact, I can attribute many of my recent life/career decisions to what I encountered at that first WordCamp in Dallas of 2009. New friendships were forged, unknown opportunities were revealed, and my life-path was forever altered for the better.<br />
So if you live within a couple of hours of Austin, you should make every effort to attend this yearâ€™s <a href="http://2013.austin.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Austin</a>. It will cost you all of $20 and one Saturday in May (18th) and I am confident that you will leave with: </p>
<ul>
<li>no fewer than <strong>3</strong> good ideas for your career</li>
<li>at least <strong>2</strong> new friends</li>
<li><strong>1</strong> cool t-shirt</li>
</ul>
<p>See you there! </p>
