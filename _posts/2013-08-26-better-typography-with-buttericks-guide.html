<p>In the past three days I have heard / seen reference to <a href="http://practicaltypography.com/" target="_blank">Butterick's Practical Typography</a>.  First there was Merlin and Dan talking about it on <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/133â€Ž" target="_blank">Back to Work #133</a> and then later I see <a href="http://macsparky.com/blog/practicaltypography" target="_blank">MacSparky's post</a>.  There is an entire "free" online book there for your consumption.  And, if you don't have time to read the entire text, give yourself ten minutes to read his <a href="http://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html" target="_blank">Typography in Ten Minutes</a> section.  That alone is worth the "price of admission".  Seriously, though, this guide includes some very practical information that deserves to be added to your Pinboard or Favorites list. </p>
<p>
If you are like me, one who often struggles with an underlying desire to use Time New Roman or Arial, give this a quick look.  I believe you will find it something worth reading.</p>
