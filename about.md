This site serves as a brief and fairly static reference page for me, Bruce Caraway.  My other web properties (<a href="http://carawaysclass.com " target="_blank">carawaysclass.com</a> and <a href="http://webignitions.com " target="_blank">webignitions.com</a>) see more frequent updates and capture more of my current work and projects.
