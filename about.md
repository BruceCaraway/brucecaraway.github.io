This site serves as collector of my personal thoughts, observations, lessons, and recommendations.  Although I have other web properties (<a href="http://carawaysclass.com " target="_blank">carawaysclass.com</a> and <a href="http://webignitions.com " target="_blank">webignitions.com</a>), this is me up-close and personal.  
By day I teach in the Computer and Information Technology Department at <a href="http://lonestar.edu" target="_blank">Lone Star College</a>.   
...and by night I am usually doing something with WordPress.  Either working on a site or teaching someone else how to in <a href="http://www.lonestar.edu/Web-Developer-ce-Certificate.htm" target="_blank">Lone Star Collegeâ€Ž's Continuing Education department</a>.   
Otherwise, I relish...  

- spending time with my wife, Sherri.  
- my role as father to my son and daughter - both blessings beyond imagine.  
- quiet mornings spent, learning the latest geekery.  
- sharing 'Aha' moments with others, always.
