<p>This site serves as collector of my personal thoughts, observations, lessons, and recommendations.  Although I have other web properties (<a href="http://carawaysclass.com " target="_blank">carawaysclass.com</a> and <a href="http://webignitions.com " target="_blank">webignitions.com</a>), this is me up-close and personal.</p>
<p>
By day I teach in the Computer and Information Technology Department at <a href="http://lonestar.edu" target="_blank">Lone Star College</a>.</p>
<p>
...and by night I am usually doing something with WordPress.  Either working on a site or teaching someone else how to in <a href="www.lonestar.edu/continuing-ed.htm‎" target="_blank">Lone Star College‎'s Continuing Education department</a>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I relish...</p>
<ul>
<li>spending time with my wife, Sherri.</li>
<li>my role as father to my son and daughter - both blessings beyond imagine.</li>
<li>quiet mornings spent, learning the latest geekery.</li>
<li>sharing 'Aha' moments with others, always.</li>
</ul>
<p>
