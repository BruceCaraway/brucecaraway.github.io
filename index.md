Hi, I'm Bruce Caraway and I enjoy writing code and creating things for the web.  But, what I like most of all, is helping others to do the same!    

I teach in the Computer and Information Technology Department at <a href="http://lonestar.edu" target="_blank">Lone Star College (LSC)</a>.   My course topicss include general computering, computer programming, web programming, business applications, and WordPress.    
When I'm not on campus, I am often working with a client on their site or coaching someone else how to do it for themselves.  Speaking of clients, I am also available for hire as a freelance WordPress/web developer or a web technology consultant.  

Looking for help?  Have something to share? Or interested in working together? ...then, yes, please let me <a href="/contact" title="Contact">hear from you</a>.
