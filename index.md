Hi, I'm Bruce Caraway and I enjoy writing code and creating things on the web.  But, what I like most of all, is helping others to do the same!    

By day, I teach in the Computer and Information Technology Department at <a href="http://lonestar.edu" target="_blank">Lone Star College LSC)</a>.   
...and by night I am usually doing something with HTML/CSS or WordPress.  Either working on a client site or teaching someone else how to in an <a href="http://www.lonestar.edu/Web-Developer-ce-Certificate.htm" target="_blank">LSC Continuing Education class</a>.   
  
Speaking of clients, I am also available for hire as a freelance WordPress/web developer or a web technology consultant.  

Have something to share? Or interested in working together? ...then, please give me a <a href="/contact" title="Contact">shout</a>.
