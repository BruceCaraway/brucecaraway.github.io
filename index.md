Hi, I'm Bruce Caraway and I enjoy creating things on the web and helping others to do the same!    

By day I teach in the Computer and Information Technology Department at <a href="http://lonestar.edu" target="_blank">Lone Star College</a>.   
...and by night I am usually doing something with WordPress.  Either working on a site or coaching someone else how to in <a href="http://www.lonestar.edu/Web-Developer-ce-Certificate.htm" target="_blank">Lone Star College's Continuing Education department</a>.   
  
I'm also available for hire as a freelance WordPress/web developer, coach, or consultant.  Have something to share? Or interested in working together? ...then, by all means, give me a <a href="/contact" title="Contact">shout</a>.
