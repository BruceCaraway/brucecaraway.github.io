      <p>It's been almost a year since I stepped out of the corporate world.  There is one thing I miss, though - my commute. No, not the daily death race on Houston freeways...no, not that.  Rather, I miss the commute for the 6-7 hours of weekly solitude when I could listen to several podcasts.  Drawing from Dan Benjamin's <a href="http://5by5.tv/" target="_blank">5by5 network</a> podcast catalog, I could easily keep up with 5 to 7 weekly podcasts, then.  Now, my limited ear time has drastically reduced my weekly podcast subscriptions to just three.  </p>
<p>My current Best of the Best podcast subscription list is:</p>
<p>1) <a href="http://5by5.tv/webahead" target="_blank">Web Ahead</a> Hosted by Jen Simmons, this podcast is a great resource for coming trends in the changing technologies that affect the web.  Discussions with a variety of guests focus on topics like HTML5, CSS, mobile, responsive design, etc.  Joined by Eric Meyer (of CSS creation fame), Jen has started an awesome new <em>sub-series</em> called "The Web Behind" where she and Eric interview a Who's Who list of key web contributors.  This series is far better than any  "History of the Web" chapter found in a related textbook.  </p>
<p>2) <a href="http://macpowerusers.com/" target="_blank">Mac Power Users</a> I continue to be amazed at how much I learn from Katie and David, the hosts of MPU.  When I first came across this podcast (over 3 years ago), I thought "This is a good podcast but it will quickly run its course and they can't carry a conversation beyond 20 or 30 episodes."  Boy, was I wrong - now they have incorporated a awesome series of Workflow discussions with a variety of guests who share their best practices in using Apple-related technologies.  There is hardly an episode, where I am not inspired to try something new!</p>
<p>3) <a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic" target="_blank">Systematic</a> This podcast recently bumped another 5by5 production out of my three spot - that being <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w" title="Back To Work" target="_blank">Back To Work</a>.  Still a fan of Back To Work, but in making one of those tough decisions, I have subscribed to Brett Terpstra's Systematic.  Another interview-type podcast, this one is "Mac and iOS" geekiness interlaced with discussions on productivity and creativity.</p>
<p>If you are looking to stretch your brain and find some inspiration via podcasts, any one or all three of these would serve as an excellent way to "test the waters"!</p>
