        <title>Only a Few Days Until WordCamp DFW</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to catching up with my WordPress friends at &lt;a href=&quot;https://dfw.wordcamp.org/2015/&quot;&gt;WordCamp Dallas/Fort Worth&lt;/a&gt; this Saturday.  It was at the 2009 WordCamp in Dallas that I forged some lasting friendships and saw a new opportunity for my career (and life) really open up.  &lt;br /&gt;
If you haven’t gotten your &lt;a href=&quot;https://dfw.wordcamp.org/2015/tickets/&quot;&gt;tickets&lt;/a&gt; - hurry, they are going fast!&lt;br /&gt;
Can’t wait to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Newly Deployed Jekyll Site</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Why Jekyll&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hearing about this thing called &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; (a static website and blogging platform) for the past couple of years, I&amp;#8217;ve decided to redeploy this blog as a Jekyll site. Since its inception, this site has existed as a self-hosted WordPress site. But because I don&amp;#8217;t post here that often, maintaining it as a WordPress site proved to be more time consuming (and expensive) than I could justify. Keeping up with plugin updates, staying ever vigilant for the latest security concerns, and hosting the site using a premium hosting service (&lt;a href=&quot;http://wpengine.com&quot;&gt;WPEngine&lt;/a&gt;) were &amp;#8220;costs&amp;#8221; I couldn&amp;#8217;t see maintaining.&lt;br&gt;
Now, don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong, I&amp;#8217;m still a huge WordPress fan and I even earn a portion of my annual income from WP consulting and coaching. The rest of my sites (both personal and client) will continue to be deployed using WP for the foreseeable future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Getting GitHub&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other big motivation for my move is that there is an option to host your Jekyll site on &lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; for free. The free option certainly grabbed my attention but there is another reason for moving, namely GitHub. As an instructor at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lonestar.edu/cit-dept.htm#universityPark&quot;&gt;Lone Star College - University Park&lt;/a&gt;, I am going to begin teaching a couple of programming classes this Fall and I plan to bring GitHub into the discussion with my students when we start talking about source control. If I can&amp;#8217;t point to direct experience with a technology, then my ability to teach that technology is questionable at best.&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ve taken a couple of GitHub focused classes online but until now, I hadn&amp;#8217;t been able to bring GitHub into my regular workflow. When I read about the integration of Jekyll sites and GitHub Pages, I figured this might finally be the way to inject GitHub into my process and give me &amp;#8220;an excuse&amp;#8221; to use GitHub for a personal project of my own.&lt;br&gt;
So, here&amp;#8217;s the new site. It will be going through a few updates over the next week or two, so there may be some layout changes yet to come. Otherwise, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;

        <title>Countdown to the 2014 Austin WordCamp</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Anticipation mixed with a little fear of sleeping through my 5 am alarm is making it difficult to go to sleep tonight.  Almost feels like the night before Christmas even!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://austin.wordcamp.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/20140425-231513.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;20140425-231513.jpg&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Even so, I&#39;ll be hitting the road before sunrise in order to make the 2.5 hour drive over to Austin for this year&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://austin.wordcamp.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WordCamp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
This will be my fifth WordCamp and each one has been a valuable experience and well worth the time and travel.  At each of these past camps, I&#39;ve made some great friends and met some really smart folks that I am better for having met and gotten to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a chance to make it to this weekend&#39;s WordCamp, get there - You will not regret it!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WPEngine</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;alignright&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=398768&amp;amp;u=461545&amp;amp;m=41388&amp;amp;urllink=&amp;amp;afftrack=&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Feature-Fast-300x250.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After nearly five years calling HostGator my host of choice for my personal, educational and client sites, I&#39;ve made a decision to move all sites that I oversee to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=398424&amp;amp;u=461545&amp;amp;m=41388&amp;amp;urllink=&amp;amp;afftrack=&quot; target=&quot;&amp;quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WPEngine&lt;/a&gt;. Sure, they aren&#39;t cheap and they are sometimes a target of ridicule. But who isn&#39;t these days? Especially in the doubly finicky realm of web hosting and WordPress.&lt;br /&gt;
Even so, having to push through the generic cPanel and multiple facets of HostGator and their various services each time an administrative change is needed just makes me tired. Yes, I am still finding my way in the WPEngine administrative panel but it is more streamlined and fully focused on the things that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And, it&#39;s all WordPress, all the time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The improved performance of all the sites I manage and the confidence knowing that each of those sites is being backed up daily is quickly proving worth the additional cost. Along with the daily backup is the ability to create a Restore point with a single mouse click. This means a site can be quickly restored should a newly installed plugin or site change not &quot;behave as expected&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;Now, three months into this &lt;em&gt;experiment&lt;/em&gt; - there&#39;s lots to like so far!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Better Typography with Butterick&#39;s Guide</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the past three days I have heard / seen reference to &lt;a href=&quot;http://practicaltypography.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Butterick&#39;s Practical Typography&lt;/a&gt;.  First there was Merlin and Dan talking about it on &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/b2w/133‎&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Back to Work #133&lt;/a&gt; and then later I see &lt;a href=&quot;http://macsparky.com/blog/practicaltypography&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MacSparky&#39;s post&lt;/a&gt;.  There is an entire &quot;free&quot; online book there for your consumption.  And, if you don&#39;t have time to read the entire text, give yourself ten minutes to read his &lt;a href=&quot;http://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Typography in Ten Minutes&lt;/a&gt; section.  That alone is worth the &quot;price of admission&quot;.  Seriously, though, this guide includes some very practical information that deserves to be added to your Pinboard or Favorites list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you are like me, one who often struggles with an underlying desire to use Time New Roman or Arial, give this a quick look.  I believe you will find it something worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

Can you figure out which one?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay&#39;s founder, Mike McAlister, is a talented designer/developer that continues to turn out some very effective and cools themes.  Be sure to give them a look!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Macsparky Markdown Field Guide...that&#39;s it!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Markdown-Cover-Art-JPG-224x300.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Markdown Cover&quot; width=&quot;224&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-212&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacSparky&amp;#8217;s most recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://macsparky.com/markdown&quot;&gt;Markdown Field Guide &lt;/a&gt; is the best of Mr. Sparks&amp;#8217; Field Guides yet.  And that&amp;#8217;s saying a lot, because the previous two have been home runs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Dave Sparks, &lt;a href=&quot;http://practicallyefficient.com&quot;&gt;Eddie Smith&lt;/a&gt;, and a cast of others characters have crafted is exactly what I needed&lt;!--more--&gt; to get past the mental tripping point that had prevented me from making markdown part of my daily toolset.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I had listened to the podcasts.  I had read the other &amp;#8220;static&amp;#8221; tutorials and I&amp;#8217;ve even re-read John Gruber&amp;#8217;s original &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; time and again trying to see why so many others kept singing the praises of markdown.  But it kept falling out of my grasp.  To the point that I was developing a good case of self-doubt wondering why I just couldn&amp;#8217;t get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the &lt;em&gt;moving pictures&lt;/em&gt; and dynamic medium of this iBooks-enabled Field Guide finally helped make markdown &lt;strong&gt;stick&lt;/strong&gt; for me.  If you, too, are trying to understand markdown for more than just its syntax and are trying to grasp ahold of it in your daily practice, then pay the $10 for this perfect guide.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a tutorial duet, David and Eddie provide a practical guide to the why and how of markdown.  More than just written words and still screen-shots, it includes over 90 minutes of embedded video showing you exactly how to use the syntax and how to use several great and inexpensive software tools that support it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think what ultimately carried it over the finish line for me, was the lineup of short audio interviews with those who are using markdown daily - their personal affirmations and experience were the perfect complement to what David and Eddie have created.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you don&amp;#8217;t have an iPad, you can purchase this guide to download a .pdf version with links to all of the same video, audio and  media content.  So what are you waiting for?!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Get It!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WordCamp Austin - Get There!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever been to a WordCamp? No?!? Then you need to make every effort to go. Usually set in an informal setting, often on a Saturday and/or Sunday, &lt;a href=&quot;http://central.wordcamp.org/&quot;&gt;Wordcamps&lt;/a&gt; are an excellent way to learn about the vibrant and exciting community that is WordPress.&lt;br /&gt;
Having attended two in Dallas and one in Houston since 2009, I can say there is probably no better value for your money than what you can attain in attending a WordCamp. In fact, I can attribute many of my recent life/career decisions to what I encountered at that first WordCamp in Dallas of 2009. New friendships were forged, unknown opportunities were revealed, and my life-path was forever altered for the better.&lt;br /&gt;
So if you live within a couple of hours of Austin, you should make every effort to attend this year’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://2013.austin.wordcamp.org/&quot;&gt;WordCamp Austin&lt;/a&gt;. It will cost you all of $20 and one Saturday in May (18th) and I am confident that you will leave with: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no fewer than &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; good ideas for your career&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at least &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; new friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; cool t-shirt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there! &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I already said goodbye to Google Reader</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With Wednesday&#39;s news that Google was &lt;a title=&quot;Google Reader to close July 1st&quot; href=&quot;http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shuttering its Reader service&lt;/a&gt;, many have taken to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brucecaraway.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/google-reader-logo.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-197&quot; alt=&quot;google-reader-logo&quot; src=&quot;/assets/google-reader-logo.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;236&quot; height=&quot;84&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;streets to voice their displeasure.  Some even starting a &lt;a title=&quot;&#39;Keep Google Reader Running&#39; Petition&quot; href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/03/15/174447205/keep-google-reader-running-petition-hits-100k-fans-audition-replacements&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;petition to &#39;Keep Google Reader Running&#39; &lt;/a&gt;  Personally, I am indifferent.  That would not have been the case a couple of years ago when I was an avid Reader user.  Back then, the first thing I would do each morning was open Reader and &quot;catch up&quot; on the latest going-ons in the tech world and see the latest posts on a handful of my favorite blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But things changed at some point.  I began to dread the morning check-in because of &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;those unread items waiting for me there in Reader.  Sure, I tried to eliminate all but the most useful and valuable feeds, but the number of unread items continued to grow from 50...to 70...then to over a 100 each morning.  And then it got to where I could no longer clear the mounting unread items each morning.  Each day now started with a &quot;well, you&#39;ve failed the first task of the day&quot;.  Self loathing was now part of the equation before my day had even begun.  Looking back now, I think &quot;Wow, you let that stupid application become such a sore point in your daily routine.&quot;  But, yes I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-thumbnail wp-image-201 alignleft&quot; alt=&quot;flipboard-logo&quot; src=&quot;/assets/flipboard-logo-150x150.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then one day, I just deleted it.  I had had enough and just killed Reader...and I haven&#39;t looked back since.  No, I haven&#39;t completely closed my eyes to regularly viewing blogs and news sites.  I do that now using a combination of Twitter and &lt;a title=&quot;Flipboard&quot; href=&quot;http://flipboard.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flipboard for iOS&lt;/a&gt;.  In the case of Twitter, I rely on the network of my follows to help cultivate the news and blog posts that I should read each day.  Flipboard provides a great looking and comfortable experience for reading those site that I follow but I don&#39;t feel pressured to open it each day and read every last article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the doom-and-gloom posts of Wednesday&#39;s announcement, I was reminded of a different way to receive your news - the &lt;a href=&quot;http://quick.newsriver.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;river of news&quot;&lt;/a&gt; service that Dave Winer crafted.  It allows you to subscribe to news feeds, podcasts, etc, but rather than reminding you of all the unread items you have waiting, it just refreshes a list of the most recent items that have come available in the past 10 minutes.  The oldest items &quot;falling off the back of the list&quot;. I am not certain its for me as I&#39;m fairly satisfied with my current set up.  But it might be a reasonable alternative for those Reader users that are looking for a place to land after July 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what about you?  Are you bummed by Google&#39;s recent announcement?  Do you have an alternative approach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If so, I would like to hear about it!&lt;/p&gt;
